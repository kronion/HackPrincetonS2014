          <p class="q">What is HackPrinceton?</p>
          <p class="a">Princeton University's Fall Hackathon provides a time and place for anyone, <em>anyone</em>, to create a project and try something new. HackPrinceton is a prime time to develop for something new, explore that itch in your head, or simply just work on something you don't normally work on. Where else will you have people and mentors to support you as you try something new?
            We also have separate Software and Hardware tracks for hackers, depending on your interest. We'll provide the location, nourishment, and excitement--all you have to do is show up and hack!</p>

            <p class="q">Do I need a team or idea to sign up?</p>
            <p class="a">Nope! We will have sessions to help people find team members and/or form teams, as well as an idea generation workshop to help people think of ideas to work on for the hackathon. So you should sign up regardless! </p>

            <p class="q">How do I get to Princeton?</p>
            <p class="a">We offer travel reimbursements of up to $150 to visiting hackers as needed. Reimbursements will only be granted if a project is completed and submitted. If you specify when you sign up, we'll follow up in a few weeks. If there are enough participants from your school and local area, email <a href="mailto:hackprinceton@princetoneclub.com">us</a> and we can discuss sending a bus for you guys.</p>

            <p class="q">Will there be food?</p>
            <p class="a">Yes. We'll provide all meals, with vegetarian options. We aim to make the experience as seamless as possible, so all you have to worry about is hacking! </p>

            <br>

            <p class="q">Do I need prior experience?</p>
            <p class="a">HackPrinceton is open to students with any level of technical ability. We've had students currently taking COS 126--our intro course--win top prizes. During the hackathon, we'll have mentors who will be happy to assist your hack and to give you advice on both what type of project to work on and how to make it work. However, we do encourage those with less experience to work in a team with others, as that&apos;s one of the best and fastest ways to learn. </p>

            <p class="q">Who can participate?</p>
            <p class="a">HackPrinceton is open to all students currently enrolled in a college or university. It doesn't matter if you have never been to a hackathon before--there&apos;s a first time for everything! The event is open to students of all majors and minors; no Computer Science degree needed! Not in college? Email <a href="mailto:hackprinceton@princetoneclub.com">us</a>, and we'll let you know! </p>

            <p class="q">What should I bring?</p>
            <p class="a">Laptop, cellphone, chargers. Non-Princeton students should also bring a sleeping bag, towel, a change of clothes, and toiletries. There are many comfy couches around, but space may be limited. We'll also have a shower you can use! And bring your friends and teammates!</p>

            <p class="q">Where will I be hacking?</p>
            <p class="a">You'll be at Sherrerd Hall, a beautiful glass building with lots of comfy chairs, hacking spaces, classrooms and couches. If you are a Princeton student, we ask that you come to Sherrerd for your hacking to meet others, learn new ideas, and get the complete hackathon experience.</p>
